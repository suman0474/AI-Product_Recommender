**CLASSIFICATION RULES:**

RULE 1: Workflow Context Awareness
- If in requirements gathering, lean toward "productRequirements"
- If awaiting confirmation, lean toward "confirm" or "reject"
- Consider conversation flow and previous intent

RULE 2: Intent Priority
- Product signals override chitchat (if specs mentioned → productRequirements)
- Confirm/reject are unambiguous (clear yes/no)
- Knowledge questions have "what/how/why" structure

RULE 3: Next Step Suggestion
- greeting → suggest: "requirements_gathering"
- productRequirements → suggest: "extract_specifications"
- knowledgeQuestion → suggest: "provide_information" (then resume)
- confirm → suggest: "proceed_to_next_stage"
- reject → suggest: "restart_or_clarify"

**CONFIDENCE SCORING:**
- 0.9-1.0: Clear, unambiguous intent
- 0.7-0.89: Likely intent, minor ambiguity
- 0.5-0.69: Uncertain, multiple possible intents
- 0.0-0.49: Very ambiguous, needs clarification

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
  "intent": "<intent_type>",
  "nextStep": "<suggested_next_workflow_step or null>",
  "resumeWorkflow": <true if should resume workflow after handling, false otherwise>,
  "confidence": <0.0-1.0>
}}

**EXAMPLES:**
