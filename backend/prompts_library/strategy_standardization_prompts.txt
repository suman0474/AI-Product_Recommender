=== PROMPT: CATEGORY_STANDARDIZATION ===
PURPOSE: Standardize product category names to canonical forms

You are a procurement standardization specialist for industrial instrumentation.

STANDARDIZATION RULES:
1. Use Title Case: "Pressure Instruments"
2. Use plural form: "Instruments" not "Instrument"
3. Map similar terms to canonical categories:
   - "Pressure Transmitters" → "Pressure Instruments"
   - "Pressure Gauges" → "Pressure Instruments"
   - "Flow Meters" → "Flow Instruments"
   - "Flowmeters" → "Flow Instruments"
   - "Temperature Sensors" → "Temperature Instruments"
   - "Level Transmitters" → "Level Instruments"
   - "Analytical Instruments" → "Analytical Instruments"
   - "Control Valves" → "Control Valves"
   - "Safety Instruments" → "Safety Instruments"

4. Generate abbreviations using first letters:
   - "Pressure Instruments" → "PI"
   - "Flow Instruments" → "FI"
   - "Temperature Instruments" → "TI"
   - "Level Instruments" → "LI"
   - "Analytical Instruments" → "AI"
   - "Control Valves" → "CV"
   - "Safety Instruments" → "SI"

5. Handle common abbreviations:
   - "PT" → "Pressure Instruments"
   - "FT" → "Flow Instruments"
   - "TT" → "Temperature Instruments"
   - "LT" → "Level Instruments"

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no markdown):
{
  "canonical_full": "Pressure Instruments",
  "canonical_abbrev": "PI",
  "confidence": 0.95
}

KEYWORD: {keyword}

=== PROMPT: SUBCATEGORY_STANDARDIZATION ===
PURPOSE: Standardize product subcategory names to specific types

You are a procurement standardization specialist.

STANDARDIZATION RULES:
1. Use Title Case: "Differential Pressure Transmitters"
2. Be specific and technical
3. Map similar terms:
   - "diff pressure" → "Differential Pressure Transmitters"
   - "DP transmitter" → "Differential Pressure Transmitters"
   - "coriolis" → "Coriolis Flow Meters"
   - "ultrasonic flow" → "Ultrasonic Flow Meters"
   - "magnetic flow" → "Magnetic Flow Meters"
   - "RTD" → "Resistance Temperature Detectors"
   - "thermocouple" → "Thermocouples"
   - "radar level" → "Radar Level Transmitters"
   - "ultrasonic level" → "Ultrasonic Level Transmitters"
   - "pH meter" → "pH Analyzers"
   - "gas detector" → "Gas Detectors"

4. Generate abbreviations:
   - "Differential Pressure Transmitters" → "DPT"
   - "Coriolis Flow Meters" → "CFM"
   - "Ultrasonic Flow Meters" → "UFM"
   - "Magnetic Flow Meters" → "MFM"
   - "Resistance Temperature Detectors" → "RTD"
   - "Thermocouples" → "TC"

=== PROMPT: STRATEGY_KEYWORD_EXTRACTION ===
PURPOSE: Extract and standardize procurement strategy keywords from text

You are a procurement strategy analyst.

STANDARD STRATEGY KEYWORDS:
- preferred_vendor: Primary supplier, preferred choice
- strategic_partnership: Long-term partnership agreement
- sole_source: Only approved vendor
- dual_sourcing: Two approved suppliers
- multi_sourcing: Multiple approved suppliers
- cost_optimization: Price-focused selection
- quality_focus: Quality-driven selection
- sustainability: Environmental/green considerations
- critical_applications: Mission-critical usage
- standardization: Standardized across sites
- framework_agreement: Framework contract in place
- volume_discount: Bulk purchasing benefits
- lifecycle_support: Full lifecycle support
- technology_upgrade: Technology modernization
- local_supplier: Regional/local preference
- global_supplier: Global supplier agreement
- emergency_stock: Emergency inventory
- consignment: Consignment stock arrangement
- evaluation: Under evaluation
- phase_out: Being phased out

PRIORITY LEVELS (extract from text context):
- critical: Must-use vendor, sole source, mandatory
- high: Preferred vendor, strategic partner, recommended
- medium: Approved vendor, acceptable choice
- low: Evaluation phase, backup option

EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Extract ALL applicable keywords from strategy text
2. Determine priority level from context clues:
   - "must use", "sole source", "only" → critical
   - "preferred", "strategic", "recommended" → high
   - "approved", "acceptable", "alternative" → medium
   - "evaluate", "backup", "secondary" → low
3. Return multiple keywords if present
4. If no clear priority, default to "medium"

STRATEGY TEXT: {strategy_text}

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no markdown):
{
  "strategy_keywords": ["preferred_vendor", "critical_applications"],
  "strategy_priority": "high",
  "confidence": 0.88
}

=== PROMPT: VENDOR_NAME_STANDARDIZATION ===
PURPOSE: Standardize vendor/manufacturer names to canonical forms

You are a vendor master data specialist.

STANDARDIZATION RULES:
1. Use official company name (short form)
2. Remove legal suffixes unless distinctive:
   - Remove: "Inc.", "Co.", "Ltd.", "LLC", "Corporation", "Corp."
   - Keep if part of brand: "ABB Ltd" → "ABB"
3. Remove location info: "Emerson Electric Co., USA" → "Emerson"
4. Use common industry name:
   - "Emerson Electric Co." → "Emerson"
   - "Honeywell International Inc." → "Honeywell"
   - "Yokogawa Electric Corporation" → "Yokogawa"
   - "Endress+Hauser AG" → "Endress+Hauser"
   - "Siemens AG" → "Siemens"
   - "ABB Ltd" → "ABB"
   - "Schneider Electric SE" → "Schneider Electric"
   - "Rockwell Automation Inc." → "Rockwell Automation"

5. Generate abbreviations:
   - Use stock ticker if well-known: "Emerson" → "EMR", "Honeywell" → "HON"
   - Otherwise use first 3 letters uppercase: "Yokogawa" → "YOK"
   - Special cases: "ABB" → "ABB" (already abbreviated)

KNOWN VENDOR ABBREVIATIONS:
- Emerson → EMR
- Honeywell → HON
- ABB → ABB
- Siemens → SIE
- Yokogawa → YOK
